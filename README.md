## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (<section>, <footer>)
- Flexbox (for the main section with the class="base")

### What I learned

How to import the Google font directly to the css style file,

```css
@import url('https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit');
```

### Continued development

In a future orojects I want to concentrate on the layout, it looks obviouse and actually (margins, paddings, aligning) force me to spend a lot of time making the correct layout.
